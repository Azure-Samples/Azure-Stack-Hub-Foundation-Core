# Overview

The Azure Stack Hub Foundation Core are a set of materials (PowerPoint presentations, workshops, and links to videos) aiming to provide Azure Stack Hub Operators the foundational materials required to ramp-up and understand the basics of operating Azure Stack Hub.

# Hands'on

Once you go through the basics, reviewing the slides as well as the videos, the next step would be to gain some operational experience - hands-on knowledge. 
The [Operator Workshop](/readme.md) aims at providing a starting point for gaining this hands-on experience, with two workshops:

1. the [User Guide](/azure-stack-hub-lab-guide-user.md) workshop - which goes through basics of what an user would experience on Azure Stack Hub. This includes things like:
* Create the vnet, subnet,and NSG
* Create the first VM
* Create the second VM
* Troubleshooting and password reset
* Monitor VM metric
* Using QuickStart Templates
* Self Service User Subscription
* Creating a VMSS

2. once familiar with the user side of things, next would be the [Azure Stack Operator Lab](/azure-stack-hub-lab-guide-operator.md), which goes into details around the operational aspects of Azure Stack Hub, including:

* Diagnostics and runnign Test Azure Stack Hub
* Capacity Management
* Understanding Quotas / Plans / Offers
* Creating and managing Custom Images
