# Forwarding Azure Stack update status to Microsoft Team (Preview)

## Introduction

A tool has been created to assist in forwarding Azure Stack Update status (Updates, Hotfixes and OEMUpdates) to Microsoft Teams. The standlone tool is a PowerShell module that runs on an operators workstation and uses a PEP connection and ARM calls to query the status of a running update and create an adaptive card and forwards to a Microsoft Teams channel via a webhook.  The tool should be manually started, run for the duration of the update and manually stopped.  

The tool has two personas audience and operator:

Audience Card -- Intended for Stakeholders

Operator Message -- Intended for Azure Stack Operators

## Prerequisites

-   Windows 10 or Windows 2019 OS 
-   PowerShell 7 (with Az.BootStrapper, AzureStack and Azs.Operator modules installed and configured, instructions below)
-   WINRM Connectivity to Privileged Endpoint (PEP)
-   HTTPS Connectivity to Azure Resource Manager (ARM)
-   HTTPS Connectivity to Office Webhook e.g. [https://outlook.office.com/webhook/\<etc](https://outlook.office.com/webhook/%3cetc)\>

## How to install

### Creating Webhook in Teams

Ref: [https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/add-incoming-webhook\#add-an-incoming-webhook-to-a-teams-channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/add-incoming-webhook#add-an-incoming-webhook-to-a-teams-channel)

The tool can forward to multiple webhooks for both persona's, in this example there is an Audience channel and an Operator channel that happen to be in the same Team. Here is an example of creating the Audience connector.

Click the ellipse (**â€¦**) on the target channel and click **Connectors**.

![](media/1e971e701619226feafc28ec5ad21865.png)

On **Connectors for '\<ChannelName\>' channel in '\<TeamName\>' team** page, find **Incoming Webhook** in the list of connectors and click **Configure**.

On **Connectors for '\<ChannelName\>' channel in '\<TeamName\>' team** page configure the webhook by giving it a **Name** this will be the name it posts as in Teams, optionally upload a profile image and click **Create**.

**Copy** the URI returned by the wizard to make a note of it for use later and hit **save** to close this screen.

Repeat that process for each channel that will receive update status.

### Configure PowerShell Environment

#### Install PowerShell 7

Open PowerShell as admin and run the following:

```powershell  
iex "& { $(irm https://aka.ms/install-powershell.ps1) } -UseMSI"
```

A dialog box will appear, finish the installation using all defaults.

#### Install Az/AzureStack modules

Open PowerShell 7 and run the following:

```powershell
Install-Module -Name Az.BootStrapper -Force
Get-AzApiProfile -Update
Install-AzProfile -Profile 2020-09-01-hybrid -Force
Install-Module -Name AzureStack -RequiredVersion 2.1.0
Install-Module -Name Azs.Operator -RequiredVersion 0.1.2-preview -AllowPrerelease -AllowClobber
Install-Module -Name Azs.TeamsIntegration -AllowPrerelease -Force
```

If you receive an error stating -AllowPrerelease is not a parameter, ensure PowerShell is updated and restart PowerShell 7.

#### Configure stamp for Azs.Operator

>   *Note:* Azs.Operator has replaced Azs.Management, if you have previously tested with Azs.Management, the stamp definition will be migrated automatically. If this is the case, you can skip forward to [Test Azs.TeamsIntegration](#_Test_Azs.TeamsIntegration).

In PowerShell 7, change the stamp name and the values for the stamp and run the following:

```powershell
$stampName = 'NWT'
Add-AzsStamp -Name $stampName `
                -Region "east" `
                -FQDN "azurestack.contoso.com" `
                -ErcsVM @("192.58.46.225", "192.58.46.224", "192.58.46.226") `
                -AdminUserName "serviceadmin@contoso.onmicrosoft.com" `
                -AdminUserTenantid 'e8321e1b-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx' `
                -CloudAdminUserName "azs\cloudadmin"
```

##### Test Azs.TeamsIntegration

To send test messages, retrieve the webhook URIs created earlier and update appropriately below.

In PowerShell 7, run the following:

```powershell
$stampName = 'NWT'
$OperatorUri = "https://outlook.office.com/webhook/<etc>"
$AudienceUri = "https://outlook.office.com/webhook/<etc>"
$PepCredential = Get-Credential -Message 'Cloud Administrator'
Send-AzsUpdate -AudienceUri $AudienceUri -OperatorUri $OperatorUri -Stamp $stampName -PepCredential $PepCredential
```

#### To continuously monitor an update and forward status to Teams

To start monitoring continuously:

```powershell
$OperatorUri = "https://outlook.office.com/webhook/<etc\>"
$AudienceUri = "https://outlook.office.com/webhook/<etc\>"
$PepCredential = Get-Credential -Message 'Cloud Administrator'
Watch-AzsUpdate -AudienceUri $AudienceUri -OperatorUri $OperatorUri -Stamp $stampName -PepCredential $PepCredential
```

This will send Audiences an update every 30 minutes and operators every 15, the values can be changed by using AudienceFrequency (30 or 60) and OperatorFrequency (5, 10 or 15).

> [!NOTE]
> `OperationUri` and `AudienceUri` can accept arrays if multiple channels are to be updated.
> If you are working with support and have been asked to forward status to them, the additional webhook can be added to both operator and audience variables with the following 
> syntax:  
> $OperatorUri = "https://outlook.office.com/webhook/\<Contoso_webHook\>","https://outlook.office.com/webhook/\<MSFT_Provided\>"

To stop the monitoring, use crtl+c in the powershell.

##### Optional parameters

**-Brief** (recommended) switch. Audiences and operators are only updated if there is a change to the update or the stamps update history. This is to minimise spam, it is turn off by default.

**-HideEnvironmentInformation** switch. This will remove the stamp inventory from the footer of the card.

**-DisposePep** switch. This will close the Pep session after each interval rather than keep it open. It will add a little bit more execution time, but may be useful if other tools are connecting to the Pep as well.

**-BridgeInformation** accepts a hyperlink to a call/bridge you like people to know about.

There are two choices to avoid credential prompts for the PEP whilst watching the update:

1) Store PEP Credential in Keyvault (set during Add-Stamp or Set-Stamp in Azs.Management module)

2) Pass -PepCredential parameter value (less secure)

#### Troubleshooting

To help diagnose any problems quickly, the function writes a zip file for every interval logs under:

`explorer "\$home\\.AzsMgmtTeams"`

Look in the zip with the first timestamp after the occurrence of the issue.  If you are working with support, provide the whole folder to support.
Files inside the archive:
- AzsTeamsIntegration.txt - PS Console output
- StampInformation.json - Azure Stack Stamp Information
- TeamAudienceMessageContent.json - Adaptive Card sent to audience channel (use https://www.adaptivecards.io/designer/ for debugging)
- TeamOperatorMessageContent.json - Adaptive Card sent to operator channel (use https://www.adaptivecards.io/designer/ for debugging)
- UpdateData.json - Get-AzsUpdate output
- UpdateRun.json - latest/current update run Get-AzsUpdateRun output


#### Common Issues

**Symtom**: Access Denied from the PEPConnection.

**Reason**: The cloud administrator accounts will lock out after a number of failed attempts.

**Workaround**: Stop using the account for 30 minutes (this will reactivate it) and reset the credential. You can check the credential by inspecting the following properties for errors:

```powershell
$PepCredential.Username
$PepCredential.GetNetworkCredential().Password 
```

**Symtom**: Cannot connect to Azure Resource Manager.

**Reason:** Token cache is wrong

**Workaround:** Clear stamp cache and re-test:

```powershell
Clear-AzsStampCache
Connect-AzsArmEndpoint -stamp $stampName #satisfy the authentication prompt
Get-AzsUpdate
```

If the above is successful you should see a list of updates applying or applicable to the stamp in powershell. The Watch-AzsUpdate command can be restarted.

Thank you for helping us test this is tool.
