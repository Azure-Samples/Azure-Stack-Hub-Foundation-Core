# Background

Since Azure Stack Hub launched, Microsoft together with Intel created a program to enable and accelerate our customers and partners around the world in their adoption of Azure Stack Hub. The main drivers of the program have been the Microsoft Enterprise Services teams (both Microsoft Consulting Services, as well as Microsoft Premier) and through the Consultants, Premier Field Engineers, and Architects, have delivered a large number of projects â€“ ranging from smaller workshops, all the way to full blown production deliveries.

Along the way, the team talked to hundreds of organizations interested in Azure Stack, trained dozens of partners, and visited a number of deployments as part of the Azure Stack Early Adoption Initiative and Azure Stack Accelerator Programs. Many of the activities have been focused on producing material to help others understand, prepare for, deploy, and operate Azure Stack Hub. At the core of these materials is the Azure Stack Foundation offering, which is a set of 12 modules covering all topics from initial deployment, to identity, security, compute and PaaS services, as well as BCDR and disconnected topics.

 
# Getting Started

The [ASF slides](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Azure-Stack-Hub-Foundation-Core/tree/master/ASF-slides) are the core modules providing information about all aspects of Azure Stack Hub - from the internal RPs, to the hybrid solutions that could be built

These slides are complemented by the [Azure Stack Hub Foundation - Core video series](https://aka.ms/azsasfvideos), where most of the chapters are explained and go indepth by the technical leads that helped create these slides. The videos can be used to learn and prepare for the Azure Stack Operator role itself, or even for guidance when delivering these workshops.
